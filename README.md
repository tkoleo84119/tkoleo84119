# Kerwin #tkoleo84119
Hello, I'm Kerwin. Between 2020 and 2021, I worked as a Clinical Research Associate. However, after learning about coding, I made the decision to shift careers. I'm searching for a junior back-end (full-stack) engineer position where I can leverage my coding and software design skills.

Learning new technology, analyzing and solving problems are some of my favorite things to do. In the future, I aim to work closely with the company's team and continue to refine my technical abilities!
